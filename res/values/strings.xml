    <string name="intro_what">Android is an Opensource OS built by Google designed for mobile and tablets. It was initially developed by Android Inc. and Google purchased it in 2005. Google releases the code under the Apache License in the AOSP Project (Android Open Source Project). Android has a large community of developers who are writing applications, written primarily in a customized version of the Java programming language. In this guide you will learn how to start in this kind of development.</string>
    <string name="subtitle_what">Features of Android</string>
    <string name="a_what">The UI (User Interface) in Android is based on direct manipulation by touch or even a mouse, you can also use swiping, tapping, pinching to manipulate on-screen objects. You will create those objects in your layout and make the function of those objects in your Activity. Those parts will be analyzed in this tutorial. The device interacts with the user by the vibration, accelerometers, gyroscopes and other sensors by your application.</string>
    <string name="b_what">Android devices boot to the home screen with a Launcher App. Those launchers are made with app icons and widgets from the associated app. Third party apps (like yours) will be available on Google Play.</string>
    <string name="c_what">On the top of the screen you will find a status bar, showing information about the device and its connectivity. It can be pulled down to reveal a notification screen where apps display important information or updates. Notifications are persistent until read or dismissed by the user.</string>
    <string name="d_what">Custom Compilations of Android</string>
    <string name="e_what">As Android is an Opensource project, the carriers modify the OS to their devices and also provide their updates with the base of the AOSP. But normally those updates come very late or they don’t arrive, which is commonly called fragmentation. In the battle of Fragmentation we can find CyanogenMod. It’s an aftermarket distribution of Android based on the git of the AOSP channel. It’s officially offered to a large number of devices and ported to almost any android device in a non-official way.</string>
    
    <string name="title_activity_howto">LAIA</string>
    <string name="intro_howto">The development on Android is based on the Java library that is modified by Google, so we will use a Java IDE as Eclipse or Netbeans. Google has focused in the Eclipse IDE during the last years building a special plugin for developing. This guide is not based in showing you how to configure the Eclipse IDE. Just search in Google how to install the ADT Plugin and download the SDK for your OS. I recommend you to install the bases of 2.3 and 4.X. Also, if you want to improve any app on your mobile device, you can try AIDE.</string>
    <string name="subtitle_howto">Eclipse Interface and workspaces</string>
    <string name="a_howto">We suppose that you have already Installed Eclipse Juno, since we will be using it with the ADT Plugin and the latest version of the Android SDK. Inside the Eclipse IDE we will find under the menu File\new/Project some options with our project. In this second chapter we will create a test project.</string>
    <string name="b_howto">Inside the New Android Application window we will define the name, the package, the version… of our new application. I recommend that you use 2.2 to 4.X (Depending of the packages you have installed in your SDK). For the moment we will choose a Holo design based in 4.0+ guidelines.</string>
    <string name="c_howto">Once we have finished in the window, a new project will be created and then we will be able to see our Layout! In Android we will face two basic ways of developing, the graphical (using Layouts as we will see in Chapter 5 plus adding sources of code) and the coding (Using the activities as we will see in Chapter 3). But for a great app we must use the two ways as we will see in this Book.</string>
    <string name="d_howto">Analyzing what Google Provides in a Blank App</string>
    <string name="e_howto">We have created our first app that Google gave us great help to start with. At first they gave us some of the code needed to run the app. So the app runs okay without doing anything else, but it only shows the Hello World sentence!</string>
    <string name="f_howto">As we see in the picture we have our app structured; now we will explain some of the components of the structure. The .java files contain the Activities, this file will start our application, and any advanced function will be done inside this file (Chapter 3). The gen folder contains some files you must not delete! Inside the res folder you will get the Layout files (Chapter 5), the menu files (Chapter 7) and the Strings files (Chapter 6). Also here in the res folder we find the drawables folders where we place our images for the app. Finally we find the AndroidManisfest.xml where we locate all the info about the app to the Android OS as the permissions, the activities… (Chapter 4). So without further delay lets go on to the real programming with the following chapters!</string>
    
    <string name="title_activity_activities">LAIA</string>
    <string name="a_activity">An activity is the source of your future app. It will start with the creation of the App inside the device and it will allow you to do advanced options inside your app. But we are not here to make theory, lets advance with the activities.</string>
    <string name="b_activity">Blank Application Structure</string>
    <string name="c_activity">In the picture we can see the package that we have specified during the project creation, this package will refer to your domain.apppackage.appname. In my case I use org.sferadev.tryme, I am establishing as a domain org, my developer name as a apppackage and the name of the project in appname. Inside the new Activity, the source folder (src), we will find the .java file.</string>
    <string name="d_activity">Basics in my Activity</string>
    <string name="e_activity">In my project I have created a TryActivity.java and a activity_try.xml. We will now compare the auto generated code inside our app.</string>
    <string name="f_activity">How do we define components?</string>
    <string name="g_activity">Android is based on JAVA, therefore an object language. We will create objects and define each object and its properties. We can define it inside the Activity or in the Layout. As this chapter is for Activities, we will declare any item inside our Activity. We have two methods and we will try with a Webview.</string>
    <string name="h_activity">Method 1: Object only available inside the Class! Located after the main void.</string>
    <string name="i_activity">As you have seen in the picture, Eclipse will recommend us to make the imports.</string>
    <string name="j_activity">Method 2: Object available in all the Activity! Located before the main void.</string>
